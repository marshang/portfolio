      			<div class="collapsible-header">The Death of the Applicant: A Critique of Colleges Admission Process in Response to Roland Barthes</div>
     			<div class="collapsible-body">
     				<p>While writing this paper, mere days before the early application deadline, my cynicism for the college admissions process has peaked. With a jarring amount of urgency and desperation, seniors have been constructing college applications, attempting to communicate the complexities of their identities in ten activities, one essay, and the few supplemental questions colleges may require. This convoluted process already poses an impossible task. If the applicant were to die in Roland Barthes’ sense, not only would this task become infinitely greater, but the admissions process would be corrupted even further. The critiques of Lani Guinier’s The Tyranny of a Meritocracy: Democratizing Higher Education in America and Karl Marx’s Capital and Estranged Labor, when applied to the college admission process, elucidate both the college admission process’ current injustices and the increased corruption that would spawn from the death of the applicant. The death of the applicant would lead to the furthered prioritization of privilege over merit and thus foster the totalitarian tyranny of an aristocracy.</p>
     				<p class="white-text">space</p>
     				<p>While Barthes’ definition of author pertains mainly to artists and writers engaging in creative pursuits, applicants should not be excluded from his definition; indeed, the process of creating an application is fundamentally an artistic endeavor, the application itself: a work of art. Every choice, every answer, every ticked box on an application serves to construct the narrative the applicant wishes to create about his/her life. The instruction for the common application essay explicitly states, “the essay demonstrates your ability to write clearly and concisely on a selected topic and helps you distinguish yourself in your own voice” (“Writing”). In asking applicants to distinguish themselves and present a voice, the application sets forth a creative task, to reorganize his/her complex life into a unique yet simplified narrative. Even the supposedly objective section of the common application, the student profile and demographics, has an element of creativity and subjectivity. For example, because much my family on my father’s side is and Hawaiian, I can qualify as a Pacific Islander. However, to check that box on my application, to present that identification to colleges, is a highly subjective choice, a choice which will ultimately affect the story of myself that I am making. </p>
     				<p class="white-text">space</p>
     				<p>Therefore, in order to construct the most beneficial educational experience, the applicant must live in Barthes’ sense so that the applicant’s intentions are privileged during the admission process. On their admissions page, Harvard states their intended goal of applicant selection: “we seek promising students who will contribute to the Harvard community during their college years, and to society throughout their lives” ("What We Look For"). When Harvard (and other elite institutions like it) read an application, they must try to understand the intentions of the applicant to uphold their mission statement. Building a community of accomplished academicians that will also “contribute to [their] community” requires forging collaborative and cooperative relationship between institution and student. The optimization of this relationship demands that the institution can foster the applicant’s potential and that the applicant can invest in the community and capitalize on the institution’s opportunities. Therefore, during the admission process, a college must gauge an applicant’s intention and merit. The former can only be addressed if colleges read an application with the purpose of discerning the applicant’s investment to their mission. The applicant must live in Barthes’ sense of the word, for as he explains,  “once the Author is gone, the claim to ‘decipher’ a text becomes quite useless. To give an Author to a text is to impose that text a stop clause, to finish it with a final signification, to close the writing” (5). The potential of the relationship between college and student cannot be measured if the college assumes the applicant’s thoughts do not rule the text. If there is nothing to decipher in the application, if there is no discernible, final signification that the applicant intended to convey to the college, then the college cannot effectively use the application to evaluate whether or not the applicant’s interests align with its own.</p>
     				<p class="white-text">space</p>
     				<p>In regards to an applicant’s merit, elite colleges claim this to be the primary factor in an applicant’s admission; however, the merit of an applicant cannot be assessed if the author is dead because the death of the applicant results in the death of context. Barthes asserts that “the modern writer (scriptor) is born simultaneously with his text” (4) and therefore his/her life is not the historical past to his/her text. When applied to the college admission process, this would mean that each application would have to be assessed uninformed by the life, identity, and circumstances of the applicant. While this notion poses many problems, it is particularly problematic as it applies to evaluating merit. As defined by Merriam Webster, merit is “a good quality or feature that deserves to be praised” (“Merit”). This means that merit is fundamentally subjective because of the nature of determining what constitutes a “good quality” and what warrants praise. Therefore, assessment of merit relies upon context entirely. </p>
     				<p class="white-text">space</p>
     				<p>This contextualization of the applicant should then allow schools to recognize the difference between privilege and merit. In the case of a college application, what an applicant puts into his/her application and how he/she structures it depends heavily upon the applicant’s preexisting privilege. In The Tyranny of a Meritocracy: Democratizing Higher Education in America, Guinier demonstrates with empirical evidence that there is a much higher correlation between an applicant’s wealth and his/her SAT scores than there is between an applicant’s academic potential in college and his/her SAT scores. In fact, the correlation between high SAT scores and high academic performance in college is barely greater than zero. Furthermore parents can “spend[] $30,000 to $35,000 to prepare their children for college” (20-21) not including the cost of private education. Applicants of privilege can pay for resources that significantly enhance their applications, and even purchase their merits. Guiner quotes Teitell, another critique of the college admission process who highlights the injustice of résumé padding: “With college tuition an enormous financial stress for many families, adding pricey summer programs to the tab is something that’s out of reach for most people, […] résumé-building activities [are] yet another example of wealthy families trying to buy their children advantages” (10). If read without context, every premier summer program and elite business internship could easily be misconstrued as an earned opportunity versus a marker of privilege. An application must be contextualized within the applicant’s privilege not only to discern purchased merits from earned merits, but also to make the distinction between privilege and merit in general. To truly judge merit, to evaluate which qualities and accolades deserve praise, colleges must assess to what extent an applicant capitalized on the opportunities available to him/her. Indeed, if the aim of elite colleges is to select applicants who will contribute most to their communities and society as a whole, then they need to indentify the applicants who have the ambition and drive to excel and engage within their current communities. This type of merit will never be dependent upon applicant privilege. </p>
     				<p class="white-text">space</p>
     				<p>However, while the contextualization of the applicant should – and does – allow colleges to make this distinction, colleges still utilize flawed gauges of merit like the SAT to select the most competitive applicants, the first indicator of injustice; this negligence of context on the part of the colleges forces applicants into the process of self-commodification. Given that the goal higher of education is to shape adolescents into informed, beneficial contributors to society, it is somewhat unsurprising that the college admissions process currently doubles as an initiation into capitalist society. As Marx explains in Estranged Labor, “the devaluation of the world of men is in direct proportion to the increasing value of the world of things. Labor produces not only commodities; it produces self and the worker as a commodity” (2). The “labor” of a student, the process of applying to college, creates the commodity: the applicant. The student and applicant are not interchangeable; the student produces the applicant solely for the admissions process. While the applicant cannot exist independently of the admissions process nor the student, the applicant’s value supersedes that of the student because by neglecting context, colleges have chosen to accept applicants and not students. Indeed, the college process has become the process of colleges choosing the most valuable commodities; students no longer apply to college but rather commodify themselves as applicants in order to get accepted and purchased by colleges. Because colleges determine the applicant’s worth based on SAT scores and application formats that do not accurately gauge merit, to produce the most competitive applicant, the student must also prioritize attaining higher SAT scores and writing convoluted applications. This work is estranged from the student and his/her life. Nevertheless, the student must give his/herself over to this work only to have the product, the applicant, belong to the colleges. So long as the power of applicant surpasses that of the student, the student also belongs to the colleges.</p>
     				<p class="white-text">space</p>
     				<p>The relationship between college and student, however, is not simply that of owner and owned; colleges perpetuate this tyrannical meritocracy because they too are commofidied by students. Guinier paraphrases David Labaree’s theory on the goals of education, stating, “the third goal, ‘social mobility’ treats education as a commodity whose sole purpose is to advance individual standing in the hierarchy of societal order” (27-28). This commodification of education itself causes colleges to compete with each other to accept the best applicants during the admissions process to perpetuate their own survival. Colleges are compelled to present the education they can offer as the most attractive commodity possible so that they receive applications, which act as payment offers from students who which to purchase their educations. Because education is viewed as a tool for social advancement, the value of the commodity of education is unrelated to process and journey that defines education. As Marx asserts in Capital, “the value-relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities, have absolutely no connexion with their physical properties […] There is a definite social relation between mean, that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things” (2). The cultivation of knowledge and the bettering of self define education and yet have little bearing on education’s commodity value. It is the brand of a collegiate institution that carries the social and symbolic power that enhances a person’s social mobility. The aspect of education that is being commoditized is the college the acceptance, the matriculation and graduation certificates that allow a student to carry the brand of a college for the rest of his/her life. In order for colleges to increase the value of their commodity, just like the students, they must engage in labor that is estranged from themselves, focusing on strengthening their brand rather than their educational offerings. The most effective way for colleges to increase their brand vale is through the applicants they accept, which explains the undue focus on the moment of admission. Elite colleges obsession with the moment of admission elucidate what the college admission process has become: elite colleges accepting the applicants who will perpetuate their status and survival. Colleges use the applicant commodities for their symbolic social value. While having a talented, gifted student body helps maintain a college’s privilege, because wealth and privilege are often self-perpetuating, applicants of privilege most successfully ensure the preservation of a college’s privilege. Because higher education increases a person’s social mobility, as a result, people of privilege will have even more advantage in maintaining their privilege and their places amongst the ruling class. Thus, rather than shaping a democratic society, colleges will help create and preserve an unjust aristocracy that values and rewards privilege above all. </p>
     				<p class="white-text">space</p>
     				<p>Student and colleges are both the agents and victims of commodifcation in the admissions process. While keeping the applicant alive in Barthes’ sense does not solve this problem with the commodifaction in the admissions process, the death of the author would certainly exacerbate it further. Barthes defines the death of the author as the birth of the reader, the liberation and democratization of the reader, balancing the power between author and reader. However, the problem in admissions process is not an imbalance of power. Students and colleges commodify each other in a vicious cycle. So long as the colleges are commodified, they must choose applicants of privilege in order to ensure their survival. To give colleges drastic power over students would only move the admission process farther away from its intended goal: creating beneficial, collaborative relationships between colleges and students that lead to educations which prepare students to better society. While I cannot conceive of concrete solution for the college admissions process, recognizing my own agency in this process has been a start. While applying to college, I’ve found it important to remember that my goal is to attain educational opportunity and not an acceptance letter. Pursuing education should be a noble and fulfilling endeavor, the cultivation of knowledge and self that will empower me to give back to others. This may not be a solution to the problem, but it might be the first necessary step to solve it.</p>

      			<div class="collapsible-header">Persephone's Justice in Ovid's Metamorphoses</div>
     			<div class="collapsible-body">
     			<p>Just as death completes life, the afterlife is often envisioned as the righteous balance to this one. In this type of imagined afterlife, an individual’s fate corresponds to his/her deeds in life. It promises and ensures a universal moral equilibrium in which humanity’s inconstant virtue inevitably resolves in justice. However, in ancient Greek mythology, gods as fickle and flawed as humans rule the underworld and manipulate how and for whom justice is served. Ovid’s Metamorphoses illustrates the ambiguous and selective justice that results from godly influence through the retelling of Orpheus’ adventure to the underworld. Many versions of the Orpheus myth emphasize Orpheus’ extraordinary musical talent as the power that opens a passage to the underworld and grants him the opportunity to reclaim his love Eurydice from death in spite of their star-crossed destiny. In contrast, Orpheus’ lyrics in Metamorphoses reveal his intention to appeal specifically to Persephone. Orpheus attempts to connect Persephone personally to their love story and have her allow a change in fate. As a result, Orpheus’ quest delivers the justice for Eurydice that Persephone ultimately wishes for herself, demonstrating how the humaneness of the gods allows compassion to define justice in the underworld.</p>
     			<p class="white-text">space</p>
     			<p>When Orpheus sings his plea to Hades and Persephone, his diction specifically parallels Persephone to Eurydice and their misfortunes. Orpheus quickly establishes their similarities when he describes Eurydice as the victim of a viper that “stole her budding years” (X.22). Ascribing “budding” to Eurydice immediately connects her to Persephone, goddess of flowers. The word “stole” then directly parallels the women’s journey to the underworld. Like the viper stole Eurydice for the earth, Hades kidnapped Persephone to be his bride. Because Orpheus immediately compares the two women, the appeal he makes for Eurydice can be applied to Persephone as well. Orpheus argues that when Eurydice’s “ripening years reach their due term,” (X.37) the underworld will rightfully be her “home” (X.35). With her youth unfinished, Eurydice does not deserve to have the underworld as home, and neither does Persephone. When placed together, the words “ripening” and “home” could remind Persephone of her mother, Demeter. The eternally young goddess belongs with her mother, goddess of the harvest, in the world above. Through the parallels between Eurydice and herself, Persephone can be reminded of her unwanted circumstance.</p>
     			<p class="white-text">space</p>
     			<p>Orpheus does not just highlight how Eurydice and Persephone’s fates are similarly unfortunate, but also how they are similarly unjust. Although ostensibly Orpheus appeals to Hades and Persephone as lovers, his diction again suggests that he covertly pleads to Persephone. In articulating his motivation for his quest, Orpheus most clearly emphasizes the injustice Persephone’s fate. Orpheus proclaims that he journeys to the underworld because in his heart “love has won, a god whose fame is fair/ [i]n the world above” (X.24-5). By qualifying love’s fairness with the phrase “[i]n the world above,” he implies that that may not be the cause in the underworld. Moreover, he suggests that his presence in the underworld is justified specifically because love brought him here. That is not the case with Persephone. Orpheus references Hades and Persephone’s union as “that ancient tale/ [o]f ravishment” (X.26-7). Although he says that they “were joined/ [i]n love,” (X.27-8) the initial descriptor “ravishment” points to Persephone’s seizure against her will. As Orpheus begs Hades and Persephone “for [his] dear wife’s sake,” (X.20) he simultaneously implores Persephone to help him as a way of honoring her own circumstance. Although Persephone may not have the power to enact her own justice, perhaps she could assist in granting it for a kindred spirit. </p>
     			<p class="white-text">space</p>
     			<p>However, although Orpheus may believe the underworld—host of untimely death—as unjust and ultimately “curse[s] Hell’s cruelty” (X.69) when he fails to reclaim Eurydice, in Persephone and Orpheus’ myths, the underworld yields to the pain of the living. Demeter’s grief motivates the compromise of Persephone’s return. The underworld releases her not only because of the immensity of Demeter’s emotion but also because of the pain her grief inflicts upon humanity. As Edith Hamilton describes in her version of the Persephone myth, Zeus sends Hermes to retrieve Persephone to save humanity from starvation (Hamilton 33), illustrating how the gods can manipulate the underworld to assuage humanity’s pain. However, when Orpheus grieves, both the gods and the underworld itself treat him with pity. After Orpheus, “the bard of Rhodope/ [h]ad mourned his fill in the wide world above” (Ovid X.12-13), he sings his appeal to the underworld, the only place left to turn. While the world above remains unchanged by Orpheus’ expression of grief, the underworld reacts with sympathy. His performance literally halts Ixion’s wheel and makes “[t]he Furies’ cheeks […] wet with tears” (X.49). Both Persephone and “he whose scepter rules/ [t]he Underworld could not deny [his] prayer” (X.45-6) because in this world order, grief must sway the underworld. To counterbalance the upper world’s indifference to suffering, the underworld acts with pliancy and compassion.</p>
     			<p class="white-text">space</p>
     			<p>The sympathetic nature of the underworld in both myths also offsets the arbitrary way in which misfortune occurs in life. Eurydice and Persephone end up in the underworld by happenstance. Although her marriage may be an “ill-starred rite,” (X.10) there is no specific reason why the snake bites her, nor is there any particular force that drives Hades to fall in love with Persephone. Misfortune randomly afflicts them. Even when Persephone and Orpheus cause their own misfortune, it retains an element of purposelessness. Persephone must stay and return to the underworld because she ate the six pomegranate seeds. The size of the seeds alone highlights the arbitrariness of her action. Her situation would have resolved perfectly has she abstained from that one regrettable action, and yet that small action had disproportionally massive repercussions. Similarly, Orpheus need only avoid looking back, and he and Eurydice can leave the underworld together. The act of looking back can be interpreted as the physical signification of regret. If only Orpheus avoid regret, he may forge a success escape from the underworld with his love, but he cannot. So long misfortune, error, and regret occur in this senseless way, suffering continues to plague life.</p>
     			<p class="white-text">space</p>
     			<p>Indeed, by the end of Orpheus’ attempt to save Eurydice, Orpheus’ circumstance mirrors Demeter’s, emphasizing suffering as a primary component of life. The new onslaught of grief “[steals] Orpheus’ wits away” (X.65), for no clever appeals to gods can help him this time. When he fails to beg for passage into the underworld a second time, the permanence of his loss devastates him. Although Orpheus is merely human, his pain ruins him nearly to the same degree as the goddess Demeter when she loses Persephone. For a week, Orpheus sits “upon the bank,/ [u]nkempt and fasting, anguish, grief and tears/ [h]is nourishment” (X.77-9). Orpheus’ suffering destroys his will to sustain himself much as it does Demeter. In the Edith Hamilton’s version of the myth, “[n]ine days Demeter wander[s], and all that time she would not taste ambrosia or put sweet nectar to her lips” (Hamilton 31). The parallel between both characters suffering, particularly the fasting, also implies how they both thrived. Their love for Eurydice and Persephone respectively infused their lives with energy and vitality. Without their presences, Orpheus and Demeter are alive only in the bodily sense, no more animated in spirit than ghosts. Without the resolution of death, the living must bear the grief of love that—albeit incomplete—survives in them. Their existences become about more endurance rather than life. In this way, love assures the suffering of the living in both myths. </p>
     			<p class="white-text">space</p>
     			<p>Even though Orpheus’ quest may seem overtly unsuccessful, it reaps the most positive outcome for Eurydice possible: a release from suffering. The myth initially introduces Orpheus and Eurydice’s marriage as an “ill-starred rite,” (Ovid X.10) signaling that fate—a force unmoved even by the gods—dooms the lovers to tragedy. In granting Orpheus’ request, the intention cannot be to allow Orpheus to reclaim Eurydice, a request beyond Persephone and Hades’ control. Orpheus’ quest only gives Orpheus the opportunity to achieve his purpose as it is most literally expressed: “to enjoy her love” (X.39). If Orpheus had focused solely on enjoying Eurydice’s love rather than succumbing to his doubt, “fearing lest she faint,” and his “longing to look back,” (X.56) the outcome might have been in his favor. However, these negative emotions that undermine Orpheus’ quest for love result from love itself. Love dooms Orpheus’ quest for love. Indeed, Eurydice’s feelings also demonstrate how love unavoidably incurs suffering and pain. When Hades and Persephone call her to leave with Orpheus, she “limp[s] from her wound” (X.48). She once again experiences corporeal sensation. Orpheus’ love brings her closer to life, and it is unpleasant. Furthermore, the single line that articulates Eurydice’s feelings about the journey may also be the most important: “For what complaint had she save she was love?” (X.61). The only complaint Eurydice has is love, that love compels them to exert themselves only to reap more pain and grief. Death and its finality bring Eurydice no such misery. Persephone by comparison perpetually cycles between the under and upper worlds, reuniting with Demeter and reopening her grief. Perhaps a better justice for Persephone would be what Eurydice receives: a conclusion to her experience with love and pain.</p>
     			<p class="white-text">space</p>
     			<p>While Persephone may never receive perfect justice, the sympathetic nature of the underworld and the gods enables Eurydice to achieve more fairness in her death than Persephone. Orpheus successfully garners Persephone’s vested interest in their love story, using both his lyrics and his grief to make the underworld yield to his request. When justice in the afterlife can be swayed by gods with imperfections and personal motivations, absolute justice can never be guaranteed. However, maybe this style of justice portrays a more hopeful version of the afterlife. The mercurial gods align the randomness of misfortune and the carelessness of error. Perhaps this qualifies them to parse out justice with more fairness than a structure of absolute justice allows. Ovid’s version the Orpheus myth articulates that Persephone’s humaneness and the underworld’s sympathy transform the justice Eurydice receives, as subtle and nuanced as it is. Perhaps believing in an afterlife where fates may be shifted by forces motivated by empathy and compassion envisions a better form of other worldly justice. With this type of afterlife, what waits with death is not punishment, but peace. </p>

					<p>And in that cavern, our pulse</p>

					<p>to little more than an echo,</p>
					<p>that could barely shakes a single tear</p>
					<p class="white-text">space</p>
					<p>But if I give you</p>
					<p>the last of our heart, our rhythm </p>
					<p>would spend your days</p>
					<p>twirling,</p>
					<p>laughing, </p>
					<p>dancing,</p>
					<p>and filling that cavern</p>
					<p>that has become me?</p>
					<p class="white-text">space</p>
					<p>I’ll be your box, you my ballerina.</p>
					<p>I’ll guard your life inside me,</p>
					<p>and keep your memory playing</p>
					<p>because maybe together, </p>
					<p>we can both feel</p>
